## Technology Stack 

- *React.js* ‚Äì We used React to build the frontend because it makes the app fast and smooth. Its component-based design allowed us to easily create reusable pieces like buttons, cards, and dashboards.  

- *TypeScript* ‚Äì Since our project is large, TypeScript helps us avoid silly errors by adding types. It makes the code cleaner, safer, and easier for the whole team to work on together.  

- *React Router* ‚Äì This makes our app feel like a real application rather than a website. It lets users switch between pages (like dashboard, modules, reports) instantly without reloading.  

- *Context API* ‚Äì Instead of passing data through many layers of components, we used Context to manage global things like login state and theme across the app easily.  

- *Tailwind CSS* ‚Äì For styling, Tailwind made our work super quick. With its utility classes, we didn‚Äôt have to write long CSS files, and the UI looks consistent and modern.  

- *Framer Motion* ‚Äì To make the app engaging, we added smooth animations (like transitions and modals). It gives the app a polished, professional feel.  

- *Recharts* ‚Äì For teachers and admins, we wanted clear visuals of reports and scores. Recharts let us build interactive charts that are simple to understand.  

- *i18next* ‚Äì Since our users may prefer different languages, we added support for both English and Hindi to make the app more inclusive.  

- *Node.js & Express.js* ‚Äì These power our backend. Together, they handle things like login, saving reports, and sending alerts.  

- *MongoDB* ‚Äì We chose MongoDB as our database because it‚Äôs flexible and works great for storing different types of data like modules, reports, and alerts.
